Urban mobility analysis using emerging location data has received significant attention in recent years. It has become an essential subject for understanding the functionality, ever-increasing dynamism and complexity of urban space. Chenâ€™s talk will review some of their work on urban mobility analysis for land use and transport planning, particularly demonstrating how variability can be measured and interpreted in varied contexts. Along this line, she will also brief their future work on variability to be developed within the project of realTRIPS.
