<blockquote>

One critical topic in discussions on sustainable urban development is transport-related inequality, which questions whether certain population groups are disadvantaged about mobility, accessibility, connectivity, inclusion, etc. This requires powerful analytical methods, new data sources and evidence from extensive empirical studies. In this seminar, Chen will report their research progress achieved in the [RESOLUTION](https://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/project/resolution-resilient-systems-for-land-use-transportation/) and [SIMETRI](https://simetri.uk/about-the-project) project, which addressed socio-spatial inequality in urban mobility based on different approaches, namely disaggregated accessibility measures and spatial data mining.
