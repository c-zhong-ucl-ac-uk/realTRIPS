### Researchers on realTRIPS and the relevant projects

[Chen Zhong](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/46973) is Associate Professor in Urban Analytics at [CASA, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa) and PI on the realTRIPS project. Her research interests lie in spatial data analysis, machine learning, urban modelling, and data-driven methods for urban and transport planning. Her ongoing research focuses on urban mobility with strengths developed in three aspects: (i) the use of emerging human location data (e.g. mobile app data) and advanced spatial analysis and modelling methods (ii) addressing broad transport-related issues, e.g. evolution of urban spatial structure, socio-spatial inequalities, and accessibility to services through academic and industrial collaborations; and (iii) looking into various urban contexts, e.g. mega-city regions in China and cities with informal settlements in Global South, e.g. Kenya.

[Nilufer Sari Aslam](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ha04uDcAAAAJ&hl=en) is a Research Fellow in urban mobility data who joined [CASA, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa) through the realTRIPS project in 2023. Prior to this, she completed her MSc and PhD in Geographical Information Science (GIS) at UCL. She applies transferable methods/methodologies between cities using large-scale data sources, such as transport, mobile phone data, and social media data, with the help of heuristic and machine learning techniques in urban modelling. Her research focuses on urban mobility, spatial inequalities, and sustainable transportation for smart cities. 

### PhD students on realTRIPS and the relevant projects

[Yikang Wang](https://yikang.site/) is a PhD student at CASA UCL. Prior to this, he obtained a bachelor’s degree in GIS from Wuhan University with honour, followed by an MSc in Computational Science at Imperial College. He is working on the analysis of human mobility in London. His PhD thesis is titled "Exploring the Impacts of Charging Zones on Human Mobility using Mobile Phone Location Data and a Causal Inference Approach".

[Bowen Zhang](https://bowenzhang.org/) is a final year PhD based at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/geography), funded by K-CSC. He is working on a dissertation titled “Modelling Urban Clusters in Mega-city Region based on Human Mobility Pattern” using mobile phone data in the Great Bay area. He is also a part-time Research Associate at [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

[Wenlan Zhang](http://www.zhangwenlan.com/) is a PhD student at CASA UCL, started in March 2022. She has a background in environmental science and sustainable development. Her research interests lie in spatial data analysis, sustainable smart cities, and technology for development. Her PhD topic is data justice for development with a case study in Kenya. 

[Adham Enaya](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/adham-enaya) is a PhD student at CASA UCL, working on urban mobility and spatial interaction models. His thesis is titled "Improving the Performance of Deep Gravity Models in Predicting Urban Mobility in Geographic Areas with Limited Training Data through the Use of Urban Transfer Learning Techniques".

### Other PhD students in the team

### Associated team members

[Carmen Cabrera-Arnau](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahcca/) was a Research Fellow who has joined CASA through the realTRIPS project in 2021. Prior to this, she did the MSc in Complex Systems at King's College London, followed by a PhD at UCL's Department of Mathematics. With a background in Physics and Applied Mathematics, her current research focuses on geographic data analysis, mathematical modelling, statistics, human mobility and spatial inequalities. She left the team in 2022 and is now a Lecturer in Geographic Data Science at the Department of Geography and Planning of the University of Liverpool.

[Qili Gao](https://www.gaoqili.cn/) (on [SIMETRI project](https://simetri.uk/about-the-project) until 2023.02) is a Research Fellow at CASA UCL. Her work focus on spatial-temporal data mining, urban informatics, and analysis on human mobility and activity behaviours for urban and transport planning. She left the team in Aug 2023 and is now an Assistant Professor at the Shenzhen Audencia Financial Technology Institute.
