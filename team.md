### Staff members on realTRIPS and the relevant projects

[Chen Zhong](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/46973) is Associate Professor in Urban Analytics at [CASA, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa) and PI on the realTRIPS project. Her research interests lie in spatial data analysis, machine learning, urban modelling, and data-driven methods for urban and transport planning. Her ongoing research focuses on urban mobility with strengths developed in three aspects: (i) the use of emerging human location data (e.g. mobile app data) and advanced spatial analysis and modelling methods (ii) addressing broad transport-related issues, e.g. evolution of urban spatial structure, socio-spatial inequalities, and accessibility to services through academic and industrial collaborations; and (iii) looking into various urban contexts, e.g. mega-city regions in China and cities with informal settlements in Global South, e.g. Kenya.

[Nilufer Sari Aslam](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ha04uDcAAAAJ&hl=en) is a Research Fellow in urban mobility data who joined [CASA, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa) through the realTRIPS project in 2023. Prior to this, she completed her MSc and PhD in Geographical Information Science (GIS) at UCL. She applies transferable methods/methodologies between cities using large-scale data sources, such as transport, mobile phone data, and social media data, with the help of heuristic and machine learning techniques in urban modelling. Her research focuses on urban mobility, spatial inequalities, and sustainable transportation for smart cities. 

[Cate Heine](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rWS08wIAAAAJ&hl=en) is a Research Fellow in urban mobility and inequality who joined CASA and the realTRIPS project in February 2024. Before joining CASA, Cate completed her PhD in Social & Engineering Systems at MIT, where she was a research assistant in the [Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/). Her research focuses on using large-scale human mobility datasets to study the impact of urban design choices on social mixing and experienced segregation in cities. More generally, she is interested in the relationship between the built environment, sustainable transportation, and equitable access to urban amenities.

### PhD students on realTRIPS

[Yikang Wang](https://yikang.site/) is a PhD student at CASA UCL. Prior to this, he obtained a bachelor’s degree in GIS from Wuhan University with honour, followed by an MSc in Computational Science at Imperial College. He is working on the analysis of human mobility in London. His PhD thesis is "Exploring the Impacts of Charging Zones on Human Mobility using Mobile Phone Location Data and a Causal Inference Approach".

[Wenlan Zhang](http://www.zhangwenlan.com/) is a PhD student at CASA UCL, started in March 2022. She has a background in environmental science and sustainable development. Her research interests lie in spatial data analysis, sustainable smart cities, and technology for development. Her PhD topic is data justice for development with a case study in Kenya. 

[Adham Enaya](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/adham-enaya) is a PhD student at CASA UCL, working on urban mobility and spatial interaction models. His thesis is "Improving the Performance of Deep Gravity Models in Predicting Urban Mobility in Geographic Areas with Limited Training Data through the Use of Urban Transfer Learning Techniques".

[Adam(Zhengzi) Zhou](https://adamzhou.site/) and is a PhD student at CASA UCL started in Jan 2024, working on unraveling the complexities of spatial segregation using mobility data. Some of his publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6LwvM_8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 


### PhD students working on other relevant projects

[Bowen Zhang](https://bowenzhang.org/) is a final year PhD based at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/geography), funded by K-CSC and co-supervised by Dr Zahra Shabrina and Dr Chen Zhong. He is working on a dissertation titled “Modelling Urban Clusters in Mega-city Region based on Human Mobility Pattern” using mobile phone data in the Great Bay Area. Bowen's research has significantly contributed to the [SIMETRI project](https://simetri.uk/about-the-project). He is also a part-time Research Associate at [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

[Samuel Murphy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-murphy-4a8570171/?originalSubdomain=uk), PhD student on inequality in emergency services at CASA UCL, primarily supervised by Dr Chen Zhong. The project is an [ESRC funded](https://ubel-dtp.ac.uk/) and in collaboration with [London Ambulance Services](https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/).
